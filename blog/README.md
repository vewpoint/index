**[Vewpoint](https://vewpoint.com/) is a research project trying to find alternatives to how we relate to digital information** with the initial focus on our experience when browsing the web.

In order to explain the context, process and status of the research I will explore different strategies. In this case, I am using [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/danielarmengolaltayo/) as a publishing platform to periodically deliver small capsules of information with the idea to accumulate enough pieces to build a larger and stronger narrative to be compiled later in another format.
