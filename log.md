| `200511` | Deep dig into Roam. |
| `200510` | Doing research on Roam, discovery via Brett. |
| `200509` | I think that the structure for the second part is clear. |
| `200508` | First part of the script for the video, finished. I expect to condense in the final video 10 years of work into a 1 minute or so. |
| `200507` | Working on the draft. Evaluating other platforms as alternatives to Patreon or to complement it. Buymyacoffee is a reasonable candidate. |
| `200506` | Reviewing old presentations to see what I can re-use. |
| `200505` | Start draft for a video to introduce myself in Patreon. |

<br>

#### In order to reach more people, to be able to interact with other perspectives and at the same time make the project sustainable, I decided to start a Patreon page. It makes sense to me to give it a try. 
#### The project requires visibility, which means that I need to start exposing myself in a more systematic way asap. So, it's time to stop for a while, put everything I have done together, present it, present myself and introduce the project properly, and then, get back and continue from where I am now. <sup>`200506`</sup>

| `200430` | I'm beginning to feel the pressure to make Vewpoint economically sustainable, so I'm starting to deploy the first strategy to address this need. |
| `200429` | Planning and evaluation for next steps. |
| `200428` | Tired. Feel I need perspective again. Rest. |
| `200427` | Coding. |
| `200426` | Mails and continue coding for the markdown experiment. |
| `200425` | Start new experiment, markdown file as a container for a piece of information (content) + its metadata (context). |
| `200424` | Mails and research. What is information? |
| `200423` | Mails and research. |
| `200422` | Mails. Start a draft for what Vewpoint understands by information, how we should relate to it and why. |
| `200421` | Research day. Mails and messages. |

### [Meeting point](https://github.com/vewpoint/meeting-point) is an experiment to connect people and initiatives, to coordinate efforts in the collective task of finding alternatives to our current relationship with digital information. <sup>`200420`</sup>

| `200420` | Meeting point draft finished but not shared with the group yet. |
| `200419` | Continue with the draft for "meeting point". Questioning myself about the limits and conditions for the experiment. |
| `200418` | How do we collect and organize the information about how we collect and organize information when we don't have the tools we need in order to collect and organize information? Start a draft for "meeting point". |
| `200417` | Research day. Work and links from Bernard and Jack. |

### An attempt to explain what brings me here, through the lens of the needs I had (and still have) and the conclusions I reached. An attempt to share my current [needs](https://github.com/vewpoint/index/blob/master/needs-and-vision.md) in relation with the project and the vision that drives the forces behind Vewpoint. <sup>`200416`</sup>

| -------- | :--- |
| `200416` | **Needs and vision** draft delivered to the Telegram group. Videocall with Bernard. |
| `200415` | Needs and vision/purpose. It's taking more time than expected to have a first draft for this document. |
| `200414` | Start a draft explaining the needs behind Vewpoint. Set up an Airtable base to capture feedback, but discarded before sharing it. I don't want to complicate participation, I want to make clear where I am, what my needs are and how others can help me. |
| `200413` | Start a draft of the schema for presenting Vewpoint. The amount of interaction with people willing to participate makes me finish the day thinking about how to coordinate all the new inputs in an effective manner. |
| `200412` | More time invested in improving the template system, but some unexpected messages make evident the need to shift gears again towards more communication and less code. |
| `200411` | Set up a template with fullPagejs to deliver future presentations faster. Bug detected but not identified nor corrected: browser freezes. |
| `200410` | Revealjs discarded. Adapt Vewpoint using fullPagejs but not published yet. **Slides as presentable pieces of information.** |
| `200409` | Cleaning after Pándēmos. Relevant insight regarding the visualization and interaction with **capsules** (aka self-contained pieces of information) **as slides**. Start research of revealjs as a framework where to prototype the idea. |

<br>

### I re-ordered the capsules and added an outline to [Pándēmos](https://vewpoint.com/pandemos.html#outline) to get a quick overview of the story in one slide. It can be used also to navigate the page. It is interesting to see how you can create a text out of texts from others, with zero editing. <sup>`200408`</sup>

| `YYMMDD` | log |
| -------- | :--- |
| `200408` | Add an outline at Pándēmos, change order for some capsules, soundtrack and other minor changes. **Finish Pándēmos**, start sharing it. |
| `200407` | **Divide content web**: explanation Vewpoint + experiment Pándēmos. Setup Telegram channel and group. Newsletter form working again. |
| `200406` | Write again the introductory texts of the web for more clarity. Trying bilingual. The references used to create the story represent a very narrow and biased viewpoint. |
| `200405` | First log entry. **First web online**. Nice exercise but not useful if you want to understand quickly what is going on. Complex narrative. |
