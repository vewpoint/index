#vewpoint presentation/proposal schema draft

> "The quality of our information directly shapes the quality of our decisions. And the quality of our decisions, of course, shapes the quality of our shared experience as humans." <sup>[1]</sup>



why vewpoint may be of my interest?
what need is it fulfilling?

We want to collaborate on your personal quest of capturing (1), organizing (2) and processing (3) your digital experience, providing the tools and culture to make use of them to better equip yourself in the process of understanding your persona and everything else.

Because...
1. your perspective is unique.
2. your perspective is constantly evolving, changing over time.
3. your perspective is complex, influenced by many other perspectives.

What do you mean by "digital experience"?
- As living beings, we are actively perceiving our surroundings in order to survive.
- We use stories to represent reality, to make sense of our life and environment. Our mental model of the world has the power to influence and condition our behavior. 
- Call them stories, ideas, concepts, notions, thoughts, beliefs, opinions... or information to group them all. 
- information is the result of encoding our life experience ("to give form") ?????????????? our focus here is specifically on information translated into the digital medium (mes concretament web?)

how are you planning to satisfy this need?
what is your approach?
vewpoint's vewpoint

By creating alternative relationships with information, in a digital context.

What do you understand by information and what type of relationships are you referring to?

- You are the center of your subjective experience, you should be the central node for all your information.
- Information is not power. The capacity to process (extract value from) information is power.
- It is your perspective, you should have the control over all the information conforming your perspective.
- Control over the use of information should imply responsability on the use of it.
- Behind each piece of information there is a person. Connecting pieces of information at the end means connecting different persons' perspectives.
- bring the world together? (mark facebook) is more difficult when the system we are using does not keep provenance by default (the hyperlink delusion)
- Everything is a remix, we should be more humble and accept that we are all playing with the same pieces, improving and mutating them little by little all together. (experiment pandemos + everything is a remix)
- Our relationship with information has limits and flaws. Better relationships will emerge with the understanding of these limits and flaws.
- We can exchange information, transform it into knowledge is a task for the individual.

What will the creation process be like?

(core values? principles?)
- Trust. Do not overpromise. Focus on small fundamental pieces, build from there.
    - focus on being useful for the individual first, the collective later. (george carlin)
- Openness. We are not here to compete, we are here to collaborate on a collective endeavor.
    - Transparency, community, sincerity. We are on the same boat. 
    - Bring a transcontextual team onboard for a more richer, plural an inclusive result.
- Honesty. Being able to notice and accept a weakness or a mistake is the only way to overcome it. 
    - The perfect tool does not exist, we will not be an exception.
- Commitment on creating a new tool, responsability on the design of a new behavior.
    - Empower the individual, do not enforce a behavior or a dependency towards the tool.
